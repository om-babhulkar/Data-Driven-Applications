#Data-Driven-Applications
This repository serves as a Monorepo portfolio showcasing advanced projects across the entire Full-Stack development lifecycle of intelligent systems.
The focus is on building complete, data-driven applications that integrate Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML), Deep Learning (DL), and Natural Language Processing (NLP) models with robust software architecture.
Specifically, the projects within demonstrate end-to-end proficiency in:

1.Model Creation and Training: Developing, optimizing, and training high-performance ML/DL/NLP models.

2.Backend Development: Creating scalable API services (using frameworks like Flask/FastAPI) to serve model predictions and handle business logic.

3.Frontend & User Interface (UI): Building intuitive user interfaces (UIs) and web applications to allow users to interact with the trained models and visualize results.

4.Deployment & MLOps: Containerizing applications (Docker) and setting up deployment workflows to ensure the models are accessible and maintainable in a production environment.
